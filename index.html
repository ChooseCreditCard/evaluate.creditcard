    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>Why Evaluation Matters More Than “Best Card” Lists</h2>
      <p>There is no single “best” credit card. What works for a frequent business traveller is not the same as what works for a student or someone rebuilding credit. That’s why you need a <strong>framework</strong> — a repeatable way to look at any card and decide if it fits your own pattern.</p>
      <p>This page is about method, not specific brands. The goal is to help you ask better questions when you read card marketing pages, comparison sites or social media recommendations.</p>

    <!-- Key criteria -->
    <section id="criteria" class="section">
      <h2>Core Criteria When Evaluating a Credit Card</h2>
      <p>Most cards can be understood by looking at a few core dimensions:</p>
      <div class="table-wrap">
        <table class="table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Dimension</th>
              <th>What to Look For</th>
              <th>Why It Matters</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>FX &amp; usage fees</td>
              <td>Foreign transaction %, cash advance fees, ATM fees, late fees.</td>
              <td>Small percentages on every transaction can cost more than the annual fee.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Rewards &amp; benefits</td>
              <td>Earn rates, caps, categories, lounge access, travel credits.</td>
              <td>High headline rewards are less useful if you can’t redeem them easily.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Insurance &amp; protections</td>
              <td>Travel cover, purchase protection, chargeback rights, dispute process.</td>
              <td>Good protections can be worth more than points when something goes wrong.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Total cost</td>
              <td>Annual fee, extra cardholder fees, interest on carried balances.</td>
              <td>Always weigh total cost against realistic value of perks for your usage.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Technology &amp; app</td>
              <td>Virtual cards, tap-to-pay, wallet support, card controls, alerts.</td>
              <td>Good tech can reduce fraud risk and make the card easier to manage.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Credit profile fit</td>
              <td>Typical approval range, impact on score, starter vs premium positioning.</td>
              <td>Applying for cards that don’t match your profile can mean rejections and hard checks.</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p class="small">
        You don’t have to optimise every dimension perfectly. But being aware of them helps you avoid cards that are strong on marketing and weak on the things that really cost money.

    <!-- Checklist -->
    <section id="checklist" class="section">
      <h2>A Simple Evaluation Checklist</h2>
      <p>Before you apply for any card, run through a quick checklist like this:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
        <li><strong>1. Map your usage:</strong> How much do you spend per month, and in which categories (groceries, travel, online, subscriptions)?</li>
        <li><strong>2. Check FX exposure:</strong> Do you travel or shop abroad enough that FX fees and ATM fees matter more than rewards?</li>
        <li><strong>3. Look at total yearly cost:</strong> Add annual fee + likely FX fees + any typical recurring charges you might trigger.</li>
        <li><strong>4. Estimate realistic rewards:</strong> Use your own spend pattern to see how many points/miles/cashback you’d actually earn.</li>
        <li><strong>5. Read the insurance section:</strong> Understand what is covered, what is excluded and if you have overlap with other policies.</li>
        <li><strong>6. Check app &amp; controls:</strong> Make sure you’re comfortable with how you’ll view transactions, lock the card and manage limits.</li>
        <li><strong>7. Align with your credit goals:</strong> Is this a starter card, a rebuild tool, or a premium “keeper” you want to hold long term?</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        Write down the answers for two or three candidate cards. Often, the right choice becomes obvious when you see them side by side, instead of focusing on a single headline perk.

        Evaluate.Creditcard is one of many focused minisites in <strong>The CreditCard Collection</strong>, operated by ronarn AS. Each minisite explains one angle of card usage or structure, then connects you to the independent comparison hubs.
      </p>
      <p class="small">
        This page does not tell you which card to apply for. It gives you a method to read offers critically and to understand why two people with different habits might legitimately choose different cards.
      </p>
      <p class="small">
        Nothing here is financial advice. Card terms, fees, eligibility rules and regulations change frequently. Always check the issuer’s current documents and consider independent advice if needed.
