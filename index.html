      <h2>What Does It Mean to “Evaluate” a Credit Card?</h2>
      <p>Evaluating a credit card means understanding how it behaves in real use, not just reading a list of features. It involves looking at pricing, rewards, protections, technology and issuer policies in a consistent, comparable way.</p>
      <p>This is different from choosing a “best” card. A structured evaluation framework helps you interpret documentation and compare products, but it does not tell you what you personally should do or which offer you will qualify for.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>A Step-by-Step Evaluation Framework</h2>
      <p>A neutral evaluation can be broken into a few core dimensions. The exact weighting depends on the reader, but the structure stays the same.</p>

      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>1. Pricing</strong> – APR ranges, fees, FX margins and how interest is calculated.</li>
        <li><strong>2. Rewards</strong> – earn rates, caps, categories and how redemptions work.</li>
        <li><strong>3. Protections</strong> – included insurance, dispute rights and coverage limits.</li>
        <li><strong>4. Technology</strong> – virtual cards, wallets, security features and controls.</li>
        <li><strong>5. Issuer behaviour</strong> – transparency, documentation quality and support.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>By using the same checklist for each card, differences become easier to see and document, even without giving subjective recommendations.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Reading Official Documentation Carefully</h2>
      <p>Marketing pages summarise features, but the binding details are in the agreement, pricing schedule and policy wording. A thorough evaluation focuses on:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>How APR ranges are defined and when they can change</li>
        <li>Which fees apply in specific scenarios (FX, cash advances, late payments)</li>
        <li>What conditions trigger or remove a grace period</li>
        <li>Eligibility rules for insurance and protections</li>
        <li>Any special conditions for introductory or promotional offers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These details are usually presented in dense documents, which is why a structured reading approach is useful.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Separating Features from Use-Cases</h2>
      <p>The same card can look attractive or unattractive depending on how it is used. A neutral evaluation describes:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Which transactions the card is optimized for (daily spend, travel, balance transfers)</li>
        <li>How rewards profiles change with different spend patterns</li>
        <li>Which protections are most relevant for common scenarios</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Rather than declaring a “winner”, the goal is to show how a card behaves under different usage patterns so readers can match documentation to their own situations.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Risk, Uncertainty and Changing Terms</h2>
      <p>Credit-card products are not static. APRs, fees, reward structures and protections can change over time according to the terms. Evaluation should treat product snapshots as time-bound, not permanent.</p>
      <p>It is also important to acknowledge uncertainty: approval decisions, credit limits and specific offers depend on underwriting and individual circumstances, which cannot be predicted from public documentation alone.</p>
